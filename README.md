### What is this tool?

Google Scholar Cleaner is a tool that helps you to easily discover and delete the publications that do not belong to you, but appear in your Google Scholar page.

We have developed an extension on Google Chrome.

  + "Load unpacked extension..." from the downloaded folder
  + You should find the extenion on your Google Chrome now, at the top right corner
 
### See it in Action

* You can go to anyone's Google Scholar page. Of course, you can only delete yours when logging into your Google account.

* It may take a while to download the data from Google Scholar -- this is limited by the Google. You can see the progress bar in our extension for crawling your publication details.

* Now, you should be able to use the scroll bar to see the discovered wrong entries. The scroll bar is designed in the way that, when you drag rightward, the number of discovered wrong entries will increase monotinically

* You can either delete all detected wrong entries, or select the ones you want to delete, from your Google Scholar page.
